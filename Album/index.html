    <h1>A Little South of Sanity</h1>
    <h2>Aerosmith</h2>
    <h3>October 20, 1998</h3>
    <p>A Little South of Sanity is a live album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released on October 20, 1998 as a combined effort of Geffen Records and Columbia Records. The two-disc album featured recordings taken while the band was on the Nine Lives Tour, which began in 1997 and was still ongoing at the time of the live album release, and the Get a Grip Tour, which the band was on in 1993 and 1994.
        This album was the only Aerosmith album to receive the Parental Advisory sticker, primarily due to lead singer Steven Tyler shouting profanities in between songs and modifying some song lyrics to racier ones, although some other song lyrics had profanity in their original studio versions as well (even their next studio album, Just Push Play, contained profanity).</p>
